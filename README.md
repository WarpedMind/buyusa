hey there…
yes, the example you showed in w3schools link is similar… did i not give you the mockup i made?
i’m sorry, i thought I did! my apologies… let me get that link again. i really thought i gave it to you. maybe i just imagined it! haha
i don’t know how to use this marvel app, but here is a link: https://marvelapp.com/85d2ah4
i am not a designer, so it is not pretty.
you will see the gallery in bottom left
6 pictures, with big picture above… when you click on one of the pictures, the big one will display that picture along with caption
you could try the solution you showed me in that w3schools link or you could use innerhtml property: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2554149/html-javascript-change-div-content (see 1st solution)
i will connect you to github now

please be sure to stay in the buyusastage2 branch. thanks. (I am new to github, so if I don’t make sense, let me know)
keep in mind though that, for the gallery, i do NOT want a lightbox (modal). i would like to view it directly in the page, not as a popup. consider the solution i presented above. the one you presented is fine too regarding strictly the functionality
the signup looks nice. however, for this page, please only have them enter username, password, and email address. the rest of the fields should only be shown to be filled out after they have signed up and logged in. We don’t want to require too much information to start.
and perhaps maybe you could center that signup form and make the width a little smaller? thanks.
i noticed this on signup form (which will go away… but it will need to be fixed in profile form i think…) when you forget a field and the form refreshes, the images submitted disappear and must be redone.
by the way, i don’t know what happened, but all the fields have disappeared from the “my profile” page. so i unable to see the fields or edit them. Please restore this part. thanks.
it does not seem to be editable either
i tried to add a new gig and when I submitted, the screen refreshed, all the fields went blank, and I got a warning message… please add this to your list to address. thanks.
i know that English is not your first language, so sometimes I may be hard to understand. If I am, please feel free to ask me any questions or to explain further. :-) Thanks again for your hard work.
